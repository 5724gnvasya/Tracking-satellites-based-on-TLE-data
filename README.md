This is beta version that consists of a single web page. It can track only one satellite. To do this you need to fill in three fields:
* Satellite's ID
* Frequency
* Date

I am attaching another example of using the software, for clarity, changing the trajectory of a new satellite on the map:

⚠️ The biggest problem is that it can be hard for a user to find the correct satellite's ID and date. This issue is solved in the [final_version](https://github.com/5724gnvasya/Tracking-satellites-based-on-TLE-data)
